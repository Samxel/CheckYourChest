## How It Works

1. **Marking a Chest**  
   Use a custom item (`Marking Stick`) to mark any chest. When a chest is marked, its contents will be tracked and updated at regular intervals.

2. **Chest Monitoring**  
   Track the chest's contents in real-time. The mod works with both single and double chests, ensuring comprehensive tracking for all your storage needs.

3. **Automatic Webhook Updates**  
   At each interval (defined in the config), the contents of the marked chest(s) are sent to your designated Discord webhook, providing a detailed list of items and their quantities.

## Installation

1. **Requirements**
   - Minecraft Forge (Version 1.20.1 or above)
   - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/your-repo/checkyourchest/releases) of the mod

2. **Install the Mod**
   - Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.
   - Ensure you have the correct Forge version installed.

## Configurationüîß

1. **Webhook Setup**  
   To set up a Discord webhook, follow these steps:
   - Go to your Discord channel settings.
   - Under the "Integrations" tab, create a new webhook and copy its URL.
   - Paste the webhook URL into the mod's configuration file (`config/checkyourchest-common.toml`).

   Additionally, you can set the interval dynamically in-game using the following command:
   ```
   /cyc setCheckInterval <minutes>
   ```

2. **Interval Settings**  
   You can customize how often chest updates are sent to the webhook by adjusting the `checkInterval` in the config file. This value is in minutes. For example:
   ```
   checkInterval = 60  # Sends updates every hour
   ```
   Additionally, you can set the interval dynamically in-game using the following command:
   ```
   /cyc setCheckInterval <minutes>
   ```
   

## Usage

1. **Command to Get the Marking Stick**  
   Use the `/cyc` command in the game to get the **Marking Stick**. This special item allows you to mark chests for monitoring.

2. **Marking a Chest**  
   To mark a chest, hold the **Marking Stick** and **sneak right-click** on the chest you want to track. The mod will start monitoring the contents of the chest and send updates to your webhook at the configured interval.

3. **Unmarking a Chest**  
   To unmark a chest, simply **sneak right-click** on the marked chest or any other block with the **Marking Stick**, and the chest will be unmarked.
   
## Force Load Chunks

You can also use the `/cyc forceload <true|false>` command to enable or disable chunk force loading for marked chests. This ensures that the chunk where the chest is located remains loaded, even if no players are nearby.

Additionally, you can configure this setting in the mod's configuration file (`config/checkyourchest-common.toml`). For example:
```toml
forceLoadChunks = true  # Ensures marked chests' chunks are always loaded
```
By default, chunk force loading is disabled. If enabled, chunks containing marked chests will remain loaded to guarantee uninterrupted monitoring and updates.
